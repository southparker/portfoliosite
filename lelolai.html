	Le Lo Lai! Poster	
	</div>

	<div id="description">
	Jibaro music is a very communal activity. Due to the wide variety of instruments involved, it is impossible to play alone. The poster includes all the elements required to play Jibaro music. These instruments can be described as distinctly Puerto Rican. The phrase, “Le Lo Lai!” is sung between stanzas and is synonymous with Jibaro music. Today, Jibaro music is mostly played at Christmas time and is thus associated with Christmas in Puerto Rico. This poster aims to go back to the music’s roots when it was played after a hard day’s work. 

	The poster was sold at CCA’s Home: Making Space for Radical Love and Struggle exhibition, all proceeds went directly to charities that aid the Hurricane Maria relief effort.
