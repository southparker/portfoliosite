Hi!	
</div>

<div id="about">
Iâ€™m Rachel, a graphic designer and dog mom based in the Bay Area. I was trained at California College of the Arts, where I learned to combine design alongside photography and illustration to make visually interesting, conceptual work. I strive to create designs that are meaningful, genuine, and multi-dimensional. 
<br/>

My experiences in other countries with diverse people and various cultures, along with my own multicultural background and Korean-American upbringing, informs my design practice. I uphold tradition while also embracing individuality; I want to bring together the new and the old in my creative work. Navigating between the nuances of two completely contrasting cultures throughout my life has been confusing yet rewarding. I believe that it has given me a unique perspective and I want to convey that in my designs.
